<CodeGroup>

  ```java Curl
 //Replace YOUR_SECRET_API_KEY with the secret API key of your sandbox or live account. If you are using your live account, you must replace the link with https://api.fedapay.com/v1/transactions
  
curl -X POST \
  https://sandbox-api.fedapay.com/v1/transactions \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_SECRET_API_KEY' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
        "description" : "Transaction for john.doe@example.com",
        "amount" : 2000,
        "currency" : {"iso" : "XOF"},
        "callback_url" : "https://maplateforme.com/callback",
        "customer" : {
            "firstname" : "John",
            "lastname" : "Doe",
            "email" : "john.doe@example.com",
            "phone_number" : {
                "number" : "+22997808080",
                "country" : "bj"
            }
        },
        "sub_accounts_commisssions": [
          {
            "reference": "acc_xxxxxxxxx",
            "amount": 1500
          }
        ]
      }'
```

```javascript NodeJs
const { FedaPay, Transaction } = require('fedapay')
  
  /* Replace YOUR_API_KEY with your actual API key */
  FedaPay.setApiKey("VOTRE_CLE_API_SECRETE");
  
  /* Specify whether you want to run your query in test or live mode */
  FedaPay.setEnvironment('sandbox'); //ou setEnvironment('live');
  
  /* Create the transaction */
  const transaction = await Transaction.create({
    description: 'Description',
    amount: 2000,
    callback_url: 'https://maplateforme.com/callback',
    currency: {
        iso: 'XOF'
    },
    customer: {
        firstname: 'John',
        lastname: 'Doe',
        email: 'john.doe@example.com',
        phone_number: {
            number: '97808080',
            country: 'BJ'
        }
    },
    sub_accounts_commisssions: [
        {
            reference: 'acc_xxxxxxxxx',
            amount: 1500
        }
    ]
  });
```

```php PHP
/* Replace YOUR_API_KEY with your actual API key */
  \FedaPay\FedaPay::setApiKey("YOUR_API_KEY");
  
  /* Specify whether you want to run your query in test or live mode */
  \FedaPay\FedaPay::setEnvironment('sandbox'); //ou setEnvironment('live');
  
  /* Create the transaction */
  \FedaPay\Transaction::create(array(
    "description" => "Transaction for john.doe@example.com",
    "amount" => 2000,
    "currency" => ["iso" => "XOF"],
    "callback_url" => "https://maplateforme.com/callback",
    "customer" => [
        "firstname" => "John",
        "lastname" => "Doe",
        "email" => "john.doe@example.com",
        "phone_number" => [
            "number" => "+22997808080",
            "country" => "bj"
        ]
    ],
    "sub_accounts_commisssions" => [
      [
        "reference" => "acc_xxxxxxxxx",
        "amount" => 1500
      ]
    ]
  ));
```

</CodeGroup>

In this example, **1,500 XOF** will be transferred to the sub-account of the service provider **(acc_xxxxxxxxx)**, while the main account **retains the remaining amount** after deducting FedaPay fees.

<Warning>
  **Note:** The total distributed amount must be less than the transaction amount minus FedaPay commissions; otherwise, the transaction will fail.
</Warning>

```java Curl
//Replace YOUR_SECRET_API_KEY with the secret API key of your sandbox or live account. If you are using your live account, you must replace the link with https://api.fedapay.com/v1/auth/sub_account_invitations

curl -X POST \
  https://sandbox-api.fedapay.com/v1/auth/sub_account_invitations \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_SECRET_API_KEY' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
        "email" : "john.doe@example.com",
