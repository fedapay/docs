---

When submitting your FedaPay account for validation, certain information or documents may lead to rejection if they are incomplete, incorrect, or non-compliant with regulatory requirements.This section explains the main causes of rejection and the best practices to follow to maximize your chances of approval on the first submission.

## 1. Insufficiently Detailed Business Address

* **Frequent cause of rejection**: The address provided is too vague or incomplete (e.g., only a city or neighborhood).

* **What you should do** : Provide a detailed business address including at least:

   * City
   * Neighborhood
   * House name or owner’s name
   * Lot or block number, if available

This level of detail helps verify the real existence and physical location of the business.


## 2. Non-compliant or Imprecise Business Description

* **Frequent cause of rejection** :  the business description does not reflect the legal reality of the company or is too generic.

* **What you should do** : in the Detailed Business Description field :

    * Clearly describe the products you sell or the services you provide
    * Ensure the description matches the activity stated on your RCCM, if you have one

Any inconsistency between declared activities and official documents will systematically result in rejection.

## 3. Non-compliant Signature

* **Frequent cause of rejection** : The signature provided is illegible, digital, or different from the one on the identity document.

*  **What you should do** :  your signature must be:

    * Handwritten
    * Clear and legible
    * Made with a blue pen on white paper
    * Strictly identical to the signature on your identity documents

This requirement is essential for identity verification and regulatory compliance.

## 4. Inconsistent Business Capital

* **Frequent cause of rejection** : the declared capital does not match the RCCM or is left blank.
* **What you should do**
    * Enter a capital amount that matches the one stated on your RCCM
    * If no capital is mentioned on your official documents, enter 0

## 5. Invalid or Non-compliant Identity Document

* **Frequent cause of rejection**
     * Expired document
     * Document belonging to another person
     * Missing signature on the document

* **What you should do**
     * Provide a valid identity document
     * Ensure it belongs to the account owner
     * Check that it includes a visible signature for comparison

## 6. Incorrect Website Format

* **Frequent cause of rejection**:  the website field contains plain text (e.g., facebook.com/page) instead of a valid URL.

* **What you should do** : Enter a complete and valid URL, for example(https://www.mysite.com)


## 7. Tax Identification Number (IFU) Not Adapted to the Selected Country (UEMOA Zone)

* **Frequent cause of rejection** : an incorrect or unrecognized tax identifier for the selected country.

* **What you should do** : after selecting your country:

    * [Enter the local equivalent of the IFU, according to the regulations of the relevant UEMOA country](https://docs.fedapay.com/introduction/en/compte-en#mandatory-tax-information-for-fedapay-accounts)
    * Ensure the identifier corresponds to your business or legal status

## Best Practices Before Submitting Your Account

Before clicking Submit for validation, make sure that:

  * All information is complete and consistent
  * All documents are clear, valid, and up to date
  * All required fields are filled in according to the provided instructions
