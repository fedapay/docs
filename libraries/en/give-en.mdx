With **Feda Give**, you can easily collect donations via Mobile Money and credit cards on your WordPress site. Follow this simple guide to install and configure the plugin.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Download and Install the Required Plugins">
    Before starting, make sure to install two essential plugins :

    1. **Give** – the main plugin for managing donations, available for free [here](https://wordpress.org/plugins/give/?utm_source=give\&utm_medium=marketing\&utm_campaign=download).

    2. **Feda Give** – the FedaPay payment plugin for donations, available [here](https://www.fedapay.com/produit/feda-give/?v=ddd70bbaf5be).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure the Give Plugin">
    Once both plugins are installed and activated, follow these steps :

    1. Go to **Donations** > **Settings** in the WordPress dashboard.

    2. Click on the **Currency** tab in the General settings.

    3. Set **FCFA (XOF)** as the default currency, as Feda Give currently only supports this currency.

    1. Click on the **Payment Gateways** tab in the Give settings.

    2. Check the box next to **FedaPay** to activate it.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Your FedaPay API Keys">
    For FedaPay to work properly, you need to link your FedaPay accounts using your secret API keys.

    1. Log in to your FedaPay **Sandbox** and **Live** accounts to retrieve the secret API keys:

       * **sk\_sandbox** for your test account.

       * **sk\_live** for your real (live) account.

    2. Copy and paste the secret API key for **test mode** in the corresponding field when using the test mode.

    3. Do the same with the live secret API key to receive real donations once you’re ready to go live.

    <Note> **Note**: Use the test key when the test mode is activated to avoid receiving real payments.</Note>

    4. Save your changes.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create a Donation Form">
    Once the configuration is complete, you're ready to create your donation form.

    1. Go to **Donations** > **Add Form** to create a donation collection form using Give.
