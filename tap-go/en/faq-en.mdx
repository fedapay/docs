### What is TAP & GO?

TAP & GO is a 100% virtual payment terminal developed by FedaPay. It allows you to collect payments from your customers via **QR Code**, **USSD**, or **NFC** without any expensive device or mandatory internet connection, thanks to USSD payments. A basic phone is all you need, even a non-smartphone. It’s simple, secure, and accessible to everyone.

### Do I need any special terminal or device?

No, and that’s the beauty of it. TAP & GO doesn’t require any physical terminal. You receive a payment kit (a display card or compact plaque) with your personalized QR code, USSD code, and NFC tag. No hardware to buy or rent.

### Who can use TAP & GO?

Everyone: 

* **Existing FedaPay merchants** (e-commerce or online vendors)

* **Physical businesses** (grocery stores, fashion boutiques, pharmacies, bars,  restaurants)

* **Independent workers and mobile professionals** (Zemidjans, hairdressers, electricians, tailors)

### How do I get TAP & GO if I’m a merchant on the ground?

A FedaPay agent will visit you, install the TAP & GO app on your phone, register your account, and hand over your payment kit (display plaque or card). You’ll be ready to accept payments in less than 15 minutes.

### What if I already have a FedaPay account?

Great news: TAP & GO is available directly from your FedaPay dashboard. You can activate the feature with no need to install a new app. You’ll then be able to accept payments via QR or USSD, and request a display kit if needed.

### Do my customers need to register?

Not at all. Your customers can pay you using their regular mobile wallet: MTN Money, Moov Money, Celtiis, MyFeda, BMO, Coris Money—or even with their VISA or Mastercard. No app download or account creation is required on their part.

### What if they don’t have internet access?

No problem. With USSD payment, your customers can pay without data or smartphones. That’s what makes TAP & GO truly inclusive.

### Is the mobile app required?

* Yes, if you're a physical shop or an artisan: You’ll need the TAP & GO mobile app to track your transactions, receive payment alerts, and check your balance.

* No, if you're already a FedaPay merchant and use the web dashboard: Everything happens directly in your interface—no app required.

### What documents do I need to provide?

It depends on your business type:

* Shops, restaurants, pharmacies, etc.: RCCM (Business Registration), IFU (Tax ID), and a valid ID

* Artisans, taxi drivers, hairdressers, etc.: IFU and a valid ID

Documents are submitted through the TAP & GO app with support from a FedaPay agent.

### How much does TAP & GO cost?

It’s completely free. The installation, mobile app, and your payment display (plaque or card) are provided at no cost. No hardware fees.

### When will I receive my funds?

Your payments are credited to your FedaPay account and automatically transferred to your Mobile Money account within 24 hours (next-day payout).

### Can I track my payments?

Yes. The TAP & GO app (or your FedaPay dashboard, if you're an online seller) allows you to:

* Track your transactions in real time

* Check your account balance

* View your payment history

### What happens if my phone is off?

No worries. Your payments are still processed. Once your phone is back on, you'll receive a notification and can access your transaction details in the app.

### What if a customer is charged but the transaction doesn’t show as approved?

This can happen in rare cases. Here’s what to do:

1-Refresh your app

2-Wait a few minutes

3-If the status doesn't update, take a screenshot of the customer's payment message and submit a short claim from the app

Our team will quickly review and resolve your issue.

### Will I lose my data if I change phones?

No. Your account is secure. Just install the TAP & GO app on your new phone and log in with your email address to retrieve all your data.

### Can I receive training?

Absolutely. The FedaPay agent provides a live onboarding session during setup. You’ll also receive a short video tutorial to review the process at your own pace.

### How does TAP & GO protect against fraud?

Each payment tag (QR, USSD, NFC) is unique and securely linked to your account. Enrollments can only be initiated using a verified FedaPay agent ID. No registration can happen without an official agent. And no agent will ever ask for your password.

### What if I have an issue?
