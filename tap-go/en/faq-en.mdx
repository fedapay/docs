### What is TAP & GO?

TAP & GO is a 100% virtual payment terminal developed by FedaPay. It allows you to collect payments from your customers via **QR Code**, **USSD**, or **NFC** without any expensive device or mandatory internet connection, thanks to USSD payments. A basic phone is all you need, even a non-smartphone. It’s simple, secure, and accessible to everyone.

### Do I need any special terminal or device?

No, and that’s the beauty of it. TAP & GO doesn’t require any physical terminal. You receive a payment kit (a display card or compact plaque) with your personalized QR code, USSD code, and NFC tag. No hardware to buy or rent.
