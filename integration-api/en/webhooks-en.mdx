## Event Management

Events are important actions that occur within your FedaPay account, such as the creation of a transaction or an update to a customer. Understanding how these events work allows you to better manage your transactions and provide a better experience for your customers.

Whenever an event occurs, FedaPay notifies you in real-time through **event notifications**. These notifications can be used to track and react to what is happening within your account, such as when a payment is approved or when a customer is updated.

#### Transaction Lifecycle

Transactions on FedaPay follow a lifecycle, and each stage in this lifecycle generates a specific event. Here's how it works:

1. **Transaction Creation** : Once the customer is created, you can assign a transaction to them. This triggers the **transaction.created** event.

2. **Tracking Transactions**: A transaction can evolve in several ways:

      - **transaction.approved** : The transaction has been approved, meaning the payment has been validated.
      - **customer.created** : When a new customer is added to your account, this generates the event
      - **transaction.declined**: The payment failed or was rejected.
      - **transaction.canceled**: The transaction was canceled before it was finalized.
      - **transaction.transferred**: The funds from the transaction have been transferred to the designated account (e.g., bank account or mobile money).

3. À chaque changement de statut, un nouvel événement est généré pour vous tenir informé. Par exemple, dès qu'une transaction est mise à jour, l’événement **transaction.updated** est déclenché.

#### Customer Lifecycle

Customers can also have specific events:

* **customer.updated** : The customer’s profile has been modified (e.g., their name or email address).

* **customer.deleted** : The customer has been deleted from your account.

#### How to Use Events ?

Each event contains detailed information about what has just happened. You can view all these events in the **Events** section of your FedaPay dashboard, which gives you a complete history of all important actions in your account.

#### Why is it Important ?

Event management helps you to:

* **Track Payments**: You are informed in real-time of the status of each transaction.

* **Manage Customers**: You can track changes made to customer profiles.

* **Automate Processes**: With event notifications, you can automate certain tasks on your site, like sending a confirmation email after a successful payment.

# Introduction to Webhooks

**Webhooks** are automatic notifications that FedaPay sends to your application or website when important events occur on your account. For example, you can receive a webhook when a transaction is successful or disputed.

These notifications are particularly useful because they allow you to stay informed in real-time without having to manually check what is happening on your FedaPay account.

#### Why Use Webhooks ?

Webhooks are essential to be quickly alerted of important actions on your account, such as:

* Successful or failed payments.

* Refunds.

* Disputed transactions.

#### How Do Webhooks Work?

Each time an event occurs (e.g., an accepted payment), FedaPay creates an **Event object**. This object contains all relevant information about the event, such as the event type (successful payment) and associated details.

Then, FedaPay sends this object to your chosen URL (called the **endpoint**) via an HTTP request. It is like FedaPay sending you a message to inform you of what has happened.

## Configuring Webhooks

<Steps>
  <Step title="Creating a Webhook">
    To receive Webhooks, you need to configure a URL on your site that can receive these notifications. Follow these steps:

      - Log in to your **FedaPay** account.
      - Go to the **Webhooks** section from the dashboard menu.
      - Click on **Create a Webhook** or **New Webhook**.
      - A form opens with several fields to fill in:

</Frame>

**Enter the destination URL**

  - Enter the URL of your site where you want to receive notifications.
  - Ensure that this URL is ready to handle Webhooks sent by FedaPay.

**Optional settings:**

  - **Disable SSL verification on HTTP requests** (optional).
  - **Disable the Webhook when the application generates errors** (optional).
    
**Add HTTP headers**
  - You can specify custom headers by adding **key-value** pairs.
  - Click the **"+"** button to add multiple headers if needed.

**Select event types**

  - **Receive all events** (by default, you will receive all notifications).
  - **Select specific events** (you can choose only those of interest from the available event list).
    
**Finalization and activation**

  - Verify that all information is correct.
  - Click **Create** to save and activate the Webhook.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Managing Your Webhooks">
    Once your Webhooks are created, you can:

    * **Modify**: Change the URL or the events you want to track.

    * **Delete**: If you no longer need this Webhook, you can remove it.

    * **View details**: You can see all information about the Webhook (URL, tracked events, etc.).
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Webhook Event Delivery Strategy

When you define a Webhook endpoint, FedaPay will send event notifications related to that endpoint when they are triggered on FedaPay.

  - FedaPay sends an **HTTP POST request** with the event data.
  - FedaPay expects a **2xx status** response.
  - Any response other than **2xx** is considered a failure.

#### Automatic Retry Mechanism

FedaPay executes each webhook event delivery in concurrent tasks.
  - If execution fails, FedaPay will **retry up to 9 times** at exponential intervals.
  - The retry waiting time does not exceed **2 minutes**.
  - After **10 unsuccessful attempts**, the Webhook is automatically disabled to prevent queue overload.
  - You can prevent automatic deactivation by unchecking the option **Disable the webhook when the application generates errors** in your dashboard.

It is advisable to **monitor your system closely** and prevent potential errors. Follow our recommendations for optimal service implementation.

#### Manual Redelivery

  - Go to the **Logs** page of your webhook.
  - Click the **Redeliver** button.

## Best Practices for Using Webhooks

#### Handle Duplicate Events

Webhook endpoints may sometimes receive the same event multiple times. You can prevent processing duplicate events by following these guidelines:

  - Store the **event IDs** of already processed events to avoid reprocessing them.
  - Use the object **identifier** in **object** and **name** to detect duplicates.
    
#### Listen Only to Required Event Types

  - Configure your endpoints to receive only necessary events.
  - Avoid listening to **all events** to prevent server overload.
  - Modify received events through the dashboard.
    
#### Handle Events Asynchronously

To prevent scalability issues and ensure system stability, follow these recommendations:

  - Use an **asynchronous queue** to process webhook events without blocking your system.
  - Avoid **synchronous processing**, which may slow down your infrastructure and cause failures under heavy load.
  - Anticipate **traffic spikes**, especially during mass subscription renewals, to prevent server overload.
  - Control processing rates by adjusting event consumption based on your system's capacity.
    
#### Receiving Events with an HTTPS Server

To ensure webhook security, make sure your server meets the following requirements:

  - **Use an HTTPS URL**: FedaPay verifies the security of the connection before sending webhooks.
  - **Valid SSL certificate**: Your server must be properly configured with a valid certificate to prevent connection rejection.
  - **TLS compatibility**: Only **TLS v1.2 and v1.3** versions are supported by FedaPay.


#### Verifying That Events Are Sent by FedaPay

<Steps>
  <Step title="IP Address Verification">
      - FedaPay sends webhooks from a predefined **list of IP addresses**.
      - Only trust events originating from these addresses.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Webhook Signature Verification">
      - Each webhook is signed by FedaPay via the **X-FEDAPAY-SIGNATURE** header.
      - You can verify these signatures using:
    
            - Official **FedaPay libraries**.
            - Manual verification with your own solution.

  </Step>
  <Step title="How to Verify Webhook Signatures ?">
    
  **Retrieve the Endpoint Secret**
    
    - Go to **Workbench → Webhooks Tab**.
    - Select the endpoint and click **Click to reveal**.
    - FedaPay generates a unique secret key for each endpoint:
        - **Different between test mode and live mode.**
        - **Unique for each used endpoint.**
  
  **Signature Verification**

    - When a Webhook is sent, FedaPay includes a signature in the request header.
    - This signature is present in the **X-FEDAPAY-SIGNATURE** header.
    - PTo verify that the message is authentic:
        1- Use your Webhook **secret key** (retrievable from dashboard settings).
        2- Use this key to verify the signature and ensure the Webhook is from **FedaPay**.
  
**Tools for Signature Verification**

    - To ensure that received Webhooks originate from FedaPay and have not been altered, it is essential to verify their signature.
    - FedaPay simplifies this process with its **official libraries**.
    - Here is an example of code showing how to verify the signature in a **Node.js** or **PHP**

<CodeGroup>

  
```javascript NodeJs
const { Webhook } = require('fedapay')

// You can find your endpoint's secret key in your webhook settings
const endpointSecret = 'wh_sandbox...';

// This example uses Express to receive webhooks
const app = require('express')();

// Use body-parser to retrieve the raw body as a buffer
const bodyParser = require('body-parser');

// Match the raw body to content type application/json
app.post('/webhook', bodyParser.raw({type: 'application/json'}), (request, response) => {
  const sig = request.headers['x-fedapay-signature'];

  let event;

  try {
    event = Webhook.constructEvent(request.body, sig, endpointSecret);
  } catch (err) {
    response.status(400).send(`Webhook Error: ${err.message}`);
  }

  // Handle the event
  switch (event.name) {
    case 'transaction.created':
      // Transaction créée
      break;
    case 'transaction.approved'':
      // Transaction approuvée
      break;
    case 'transaction.canceled'':
      // Transaction annulée
      break;
    default:
      console.log(`Unhandled event type ${event.type}`);
  }

  // Return a response to acknowledge receipt of the event
  response.json({received: true});
});

app.listen(4242, () => console.log('Running on port 4242'));
```
  

```php PHP
      // You can find your endpoint's secret key in your webhook settings
  $endpoint_secret = 'wh_dev.......';
  
  $payload = @file_get_contents('php://input');
  $sig_header = $_SERVER['HTTP_X_FEDAPAY_SIGNATURE'];
  $event = null;
  
  try {
      $event = \FedaPay\Webhook::constructEvent(
          $payload, $sig_header, $endpoint_secret
      );
  } catch(\UnexpectedValueException $e) {
      // Invalid payload
  
      http_response_code(400);
      exit();
  } catch(\FedaPay\Error\SignatureVerification $e) {
      // Invalid signature
  
      http_response_code(400);
      exit();
  }
  
  // Handle the event
  switch ($event->name) {
      case 'transaction.created':
          // Transaction créée
          break;
      case 'transaction.approved':
          // Transaction approuvée
          break;
      case 'transaction.canceled':
          // Transaction annulée
          break;
      default:
          http_response_code(400);
          exit();
  }
  
  http_response_code(200);
```

</CodeGroup>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Prevent Replay Attacks">
    
      - A **replay attack** consists of resending an intercepted webhook.
      - FedaPay includes a **timestamp** in the **X-FEDAPAY-SIGNATURE** header to prevent these attacks.
      - The timestamp is checked with the signature:
            - **It cannot be modified** without invalidating the signature.
            - If the timestamp is too old, your application can **reject the webhook**.
      - Each retry attempt (if the first one fails) generates a **new signature and timestamp**.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Respond Quickly with a 2xx Status">
    - Your endpoint should respond **quickly** with a **2xx status** before performing heavy processing.
    - Exemples :
         - **Respond with 200 immediately.**
         - **Then, perform actions such as marking an invoice as paid.**
  </Step>
