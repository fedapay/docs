title: 'Collects management'
---

The FedaPay API allows you to easily integrate secure payment solutions into your website or application. This guide will walk you through the process of setting up and managing payment collects using the API, from the initial creation to the finalization, including advanced features such as redirection-free payments. Whether you are a developer or a product manager, you'll find everything you need to optimally use FedaPay.

### Steps to Create and Manage a Payment Collect

The steps to set up a collect are broken down into several key processes.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Collect Initialization: Creating a Request">
    The first step is to send a request to create a collect via the API. This request requires certain mandatory parameters:

    * **description**: A brief description of the collect’s purpose

    * **amount**: The amount, always in whole numbers

    * **currency**: The currency, indicated by its ISO code or number (refer to the FedaPay Currency Table for details)

    * **callback\_url**: An optional link to redirect the customer after payment

    * **customer**: The customer related to the collect

    If the customer is not yet registered in your system, you can create their profile by adding details such as name, email, and phone number.

    #### Example query to create a collects

    <CodeGroup>
      ```java Curl
        curl -X POST \
        https://sandbox-api.fedapay.com/v1/transactions \
        -H 'Authorization: Bearer VOTRE_CLE_API_SECRETE' \
        -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
        -d '{
              "description" : "Transaction for john.doe@example.com",
              "amount" : 2000,
              "currency" : {"iso" : "XOF"},
              "callback_url" : "https://maplateforme.com/callback",
              "customer" : {
                  "firstname" : "John",
                  "lastname" : "Doe",
                  "email" : "john.doe@example.com",
                  "phone_number" : {
                      "number" : "+22997808080",
                      "country" : "bj"
                  }
                }
            }'
      ```

      ```javascript NodeJs
      const { FedaPay, Transaction } = require('fedapay');
      FedaPay.setApiKey('YOUR_SECRET_API_KEY');
      FedaPay.setEnvironment('sandbox');
      const transaction = await Transaction.create({
        description: 'Payment for order #1234',
        amount: 1000,
        currency: { iso: 'XOF' },
        callback_url: 'https://example.com/callback',
        mode: 'mtn_open',
        customer: { id: 1 }
      });
      ```

      ```php PHP
      \FedaPay\Fedapay::setApiKey('YOUR_API_KEY');
      \FedaPay\Fedapay::setEnvironment('sandbox');
      $transaction = \FedaPay\Transaction::create([
        'description' => 'Payment for order #1234',
        'amount' => 1000,
        'currency' => ['iso' => 'XOF'],
        'callback_url' => 'https://example.com/callback',
        'mode' => 'mtn_open',
        'customer' => ['id' => 1]
      ]);
      ```

      ```Ruby Ruby
      require 'fedapay'

      FedaPay.api_key = 'YOUR_SECRET_API_KEY'
      FedaPay.environment = 'sandbox'

      transaction = FedaPay::Transaction.create(
        amount: 1000,
        currency: { iso: 'XOF' },
        customer: { id: 1 },
        description: 'Payment for order #1234',
        callback_url: 'https://example.com/callback',
        mode: 'mtn_open'
      )

      puts "Transaction successfully created : #{transaction.inspect}"
      ```
    </CodeGroup>

    <Info>
      [Find more information in our API Reference](/api-reference/transactions/create)

      Replace **YOUR\_SECRETE\_API\_KEY** with your API key and use the URL of the appropriate server (**sandbox** or **live**).

      If the customer is already registered, simply use their ID or email to associate them with the collect.
    </Info>

    <Warning>
      **Note:**

      The **customer** parameter is not mandatory. However, when creating a transaction with a customer, make sure that the email address is unique. FedaPay considers it to be the same customer if the emails are identical. If you send the same email address but enter different first and last names and phone numbers, FedaPay will simply update the customer with the new information.
    </Warning>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Generate Token and Payment Link">
    After sending the request, the API will return a unique identifier for the collect. Use this ID to request a payment link and token, which will redirect the customer to a secure payment page.

    <CodeGroup>
      ```java cURL
      curl -X POST \
      https://sandbox-api.fedapay.com/v1/transactions/ID/token \
      -H 'Authorization: Bearer VOTRE_CLE_API_SECRETE' \
      -H 'Content-Type: application/json'
      ```

      ```javaScript NodeJS
      const transaction = await Transaction.create({...})
      const token = await transaction.generateToken();
      return redirect(token.url);
      ```

      ```PHP PHP
      $transaction = \FedaPay\Transaction::create(array(...))
      $token = $transaction->generateToken();
      return header('Location: ' . $token->url);
      ```
      
    </CodeGroup>

    The generated link can be used to redirect users to FedaPay's secure payment page.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Redirect to Payment Page">
    This link redirects your customer to a secure payment page where they can complete the collect. If you’ve specified a **callback\_url**, the customer will automatically be redirected once the payment is complete.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Using the Return Link (Callback URL)">
    The **callback\_url** is used to redirect the customer to a specific page after the payment, with the status and collect ID as parameters. For example:

    * **Payment approved** : `https://www.monsite.com/?id=258&status=approved`

    * **Payment canceled** : `https://www.monsite.com/?id=259&status=canceled`

    <Warning>
      **Note**: For security reasons, do not rely solely on the status provided in the URL. Always perform a direct check with the API to get the actual status.
    </Warning>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Retrieve Collect Details">
    To retrieve complete information for a collect, you can send a request using its collection ID.

    #### Example query to retrieve details of a collects


    <CodeGroup>
      ```java cURL
      /*Replace YOUR_SECRETE_API_KEY with the secret API key of your sandbox or live account. If you are using your live account, you must replace the link with https://api.fedapay.com/v1/transactions/ID */
      
      curl -X GET \
      https://sandbox-api.fedapay.com/v1/transactions/ID \
      -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_SECRETE_API_KEY' \
      -H 'Content-Type: application/json'
      ```
    
      ```javascript NodeJs
      const { FedaPay, Transaction } = require('fedapay');
      /* Replace YOUR_SECRETE_API_KEY with your real API key */
      FedaPay.setApiKey("YOUR_SECRETE_API_KEY");
      /* Specify whether you want to run your query in test mode or live mode */
      FedaPay.setEnvironment('sandbox'); //or setEnvironment('live');
      /* Show customers */
      const transaction = await Transaction.retrieve(ID, params = {}, headers = {});
      ```

      ```php PHP
      \FedaPay\Fedapay::setApiKey(MY_API_KEY);
      $customer = \FedaPay\Transaction::retrieve(ID, params = {}, header = {});
      ```

      ```Ruby Ruby
      require 'fedapay';
      # configure FedaPay library
      FedaPay.api_key = '' # Your secret api key
      FedaPay.environment = '' # sandbox or live
      transactions = FedaPay::Transaction.retrieve(ID);
      ```
    </CodeGroup>

### Payments Without Redirection

To provide a smooth experience without redirection, you can directly integrate the payment form into your application for specific methods (MTN Benin, Moov Benin, Moov Togo, and MTN Côte d'Ivoire). This payment mode is especially useful for e-commerce sites that want to keep users on their platform throughout the process, without redirecting them to another page.

**Sending a Mobile Payment Without Redirection**

The mobile payment process without redirection is divided into two main steps in either the **Live** or **Sandbox** environment:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a Payment Collection">
    The first step is to create a collection via the FedaPay API. This generates a **token** required to complete the transaction.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Trigger the Payment">
    Once you have the payment token, you need to send a request to the FedaPay API to process the payment. The request is made using one of the specific [payment methods ](/payment-methods/en/payment-methods-en)

    ***Here is an example code to send a mobile payment without redirection***

    <CodeGroup>
      ```java curl
      curl -X POST \
      https://sandbox-api.fedapay.com/v1/METHODE_PAIEMENT \
      -H 'Authorization: Bearer VOTRE_CLE_API_SECRETE' \
      -H 'Content-Type: application/json'
      -d '{
        "token" : "TOKEN_DE_PAIEMENT",
        "phone_number": {
          "number": "64000001",
          "country":"bj"
        }
      }'
      ```

            ```javascript Node.js
      const transaction = await Transaction.create(...);
      const token = transaction.generateToken().token;
      const mode = 'METHODE_PAIEMENT'; // 'mtn', 'moov', 'mtn_ci', 'moov_tg';
      const phone_number = { // Ce parametre n'est pas obligatoire
        "number" : "64000001",
        "country" : "bj"
      }
      await transaction.sendNowWithToken(mode, token, phone_number);
      ```

      ```php PHP
      $transaction = \FedaPay\Transaction::create(...);
      $token = $transaction->generateToken()->token;
      $mode = 'METHODE_PAIEMENT'; // 'mtn', 'moov', 'mtn_ci', 'moov_tg';
      $phone_number:[ // Ce parametre n'est pas obligatoire
        "number" => "64000001",
        "country" => "bj"
      ]
      $transaction->sendNowWithToken($mode, $token, $phone_number);
      ```

    </CodeGroup>
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  **Important Notes :**

  Replace **METHODE\_PAIEMENT** with the chosen payment method (e.g., **mtn\_benin**, **moov\_benin**, etc.).

  **VOTRE\_CLE\_API\_SECRETE** must be replaced with your secret API key (in sandbox mode for testing or live mode for production transactions).

  When you're ready to go live, replace the **sandbox** URL with the **Live** URL :

  * **Sandbox** : `https://sandbox-api.fedapay.com`

  * **Live** : `https://api.fedapay.com/v1/transactions/ID`

  ***Important**: Make sure to thoroughly test your integrations in the sandbox environment before deploying them to production.*
</Warning>

<Warning>
  **Note:**

  The ***phone\_number*** parameter is not mandatory for the payment notification request. However, if it is not specified, FedaPay will try to send the notification to the number linked to the customer associated with the transaction when it was created.
</Warning>

<Note>
  **Note**: Payments without redirection do not support all operators. Refer to the [Payment Methods](payment-methods/en/payment-methods-en) section for more details on supported methods.
</Note>

### Automatic Retrieval of Collect Status

To check the final status of a collection, especially during redirection-free payments:

* Send a request to retrieve the collection’s details.

* **Implement a webhook** to receive automatic notifications. [See the Webhooks section for more details.](/integration-api/en/webhooks-en).

### Collect Lifecycle: Statuses

Each collection passes through various statuses:

* **pending** : Pending (default status upon creation)

* **approved** : Approved (successful payment)

* **declined** : Declined (voluntary or accidental interruption by the customer)

* **canceled** : Canceled (insufficient funds or other payment issues)

* **refunded** : Refunded (amount reversed to the customer)

* **transferred** : Transferred (amount moved to the merchant account)

<Note>To view the real-time status, visit the FedaPay dashboard under the **Collects** section or use the API to check using the collect ID.</Note>

### Add Custom Data to Your FedaPay Transactions: merchant_reference and custom_metadata

When you create a transaction through the FedaPay API, it's often helpful to attach some custom information that comes from your own app or platform. This could be to track the transaction better, connect it to a user account, an order, or a specific business operation.

To make this easier, FedaPay offers two key fields you can use: **merchant_reference** and **custom_metadata.**

**Merchant_reference: Your Own Unique ID for Each Transaction**

The **merchant_reference** field lets you assign your own identifier to a transaction — for example, an order number, an invoice code, or a session ID from your platform. This reference is stored on FedaPay’s side and can later be used to easily retrieve that transaction.

**Why Use It?**

* You run an e-commerce site or mobile app and want to match each FedaPay transaction to an internal payment or order.

* You want to search and filter transactions using your own identifiers, without relying on FedaPay’s generated transaction ID.

* You need better visibility and tracking of client payments for internal tools or reports.

**Example: Creating a Transaction with merchant_reference**

```java Curl
curl -X POST \
https://sandbox-api.fedapay.com/v1/transactions \
-H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_SECRET_API_KEY' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-d '{
  "description" : "Transaction for john.doe@example.com",
  "amount" : 2000,
  "currency" : {"iso" : "XOF"},
  "callback_url" : "https://yourapp.com/callback",
  "customer" : {
    "email" : "john.doe@example.com"
  },
  "merchant_reference": "ORD-20250701-001"
}'


```
