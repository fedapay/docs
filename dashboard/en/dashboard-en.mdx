## Retrieving and Managing Your FedaPay Funds

This section guides you through the process of withdrawing available funds, currency rules, and managing your payout requests through FedaPay. Here’s how to access your funds and request a payout, step by step.

#### Access Available Funds

Transactions marked as **Transferred** are available in your merchant account balance. Once a transaction is approved, it will take 72 hours to be transferred to your balance.

**Steps to access funds :**

* Add a withdrawal method (bank account, Mobile Money, or bank card) by going to **Business Settings**.

  * **Add a bank account**

  * **Add a Mobile Money number**

  * **Add a bank card**

* Once these details are set up, you can start requesting transfers to your accounts or wallets.

#### Request a Payment

To request a payment, follow these steps:

* Select the relevant balance (based on your preferred currency, for example, Euro or CFA Franc).

* Choose the payment method (Bank Transfer, Mobile Money, etc.).

* Fill out the request form :

  * Enter the amount you want to withdraw.

  * Select the payment method (bank transfer, Mobile Money, bank card).

* Click **Create** to finalize your payment request.

#### Managing Multi-Currency Balances

FedaPay creates a separate balance for each currency used in your transactions (e.g., one for Euro transactions and another for CFA Franc transactions). This means it’s impossible to merge funds from multiple balances for a single transfer request.

<Note>
  **Important Note**: Although you cannot merge funds from different currencies for a transfer, you can receive all transfers into a single bank account regardless of the currency, and your bank will handle the necessary conversion.
</Note>

#### Tracking Payment Requests

After submitting your payment request, you can track its status in the Payment Requests section of your dashboard. You can filter your requests by :

* ID de la demande

* Montant

* Statut

* Description

* Date de création

* Date d’approbation

Il existe également un bouton **Exporter en CSV** pour télécharger l’historique des demandes de paiement sous forme de fichier.

#### Procédure de Retrait

<Steps>
  <Step title="Sélectionner la balance de la devise souhaitée">
    Accédez à votre balance dans la devise correspondant à votre demande de retrait (par exemple, Euro ou Franc CFA).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Envoyer une demande de virement">
    Depuis votre tableau de bord, émettez une demande de virement vers le compte bancaire ou Mobile Money associé.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Validation de la demande">
    FedaPay vérifiera la demande et validera le retrait sous réserve de l’absence de contentieux liés aux transactions de la semaine précédente.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Virement effectué">
    Une fois validée, la demande sera traitée et le virement sera effectué vers le compte ou portefeuille spécifié.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  **Détails Importants à Retenir :**

  * **Toutes les transactions marquées comme "Transférée" sont disponibles** sur la balance de votre compte marchand.
