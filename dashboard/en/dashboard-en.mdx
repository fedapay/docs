## Retrieving and Managing Your FedaPay Funds

This section guides you through the process of withdrawing available funds, currency rules, and managing your payout requests through FedaPay. Here’s how to access your funds and request a payout, step by step.

#### Access Available Funds

Transactions marked as **Transferred** are available in your merchant account balance. Once a transaction is approved, it will take 72 hours to be transferred to your balance.

**Steps to access funds :**

* Add a withdrawal method (bank account, Mobile Money, or bank card) by going to **Business Settings**.

  * **Add a bank account**

  * **Add a Mobile Money number**

  * **Add a bank card**

* Once these details are set up, you can start requesting transfers to your accounts or wallets.

#### Request a Payment

To request a payment, follow these steps:

  * Enter the amount you want to withdraw.

  * Select the payment method (bank transfer, Mobile Money, bank card).

* Click **Create** to finalize your payment request.

#### Managing Multi-Currency Balances

FedaPay creates a separate balance for each currency used in your transactions (e.g., one for Euro transactions and another for CFA Franc transactions). This means it’s impossible to merge funds from multiple balances for a single transfer request.

<Note>
  **Important Note**: Although you cannot merge funds from different currencies for a transfer, you can receive all transfers into a single bank account regardless of the currency, and your bank will handle the necessary conversion.
</Note>

#### Tracking Payment Requests

After submitting your payment request, you can track its status in the Payment Requests section of your dashboard. You can filter your requests by :

* Request ID

* Amount

* Status

* Description

* Creation Date

* Approval Date

There’s also an Export to CSV button to download the history of payment requests as a file.

#### Withdrawal Procedure

Follow these steps to withdraw your funds:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select the desired currency balance">
    Go to your balance in the currency corresponding to your withdrawal request (e.g., Euro or CFA Franc).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Submit a transfer request">
    From your dashboard, submit a transfer request to the associated bank account or Mobile Money.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Request validation">
    FedaPay will review the request and validate the withdrawal, provided there are no transaction disputes from the previous week.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Transfer completed">
    Once approved, the request will be processed, and the transfer will be made to the specified account or wallet.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  **Key Details to Remember:**

  * All transactions marked as **Transferred** are available in your merchant account balance.

  * Approved transactions require 72 hours to be transferred to your balance.
