This section groups advanced tools for integrating your account with third-party systems, tracking collections in real-time, and inspecting activities via logs. It is intended for both technical users and managers wishing to monitor their operations.

### API – Integration Key Management

API keys allow you to integrate your external services with the platform. Two types of keys are available:

   * **Public key**: to be used on the client side (browser or application).

   * **Secret key**: to be kept only on the server side.

To generate or renew your keys:

  * Go to the **API** section.

  * Click on “**Regenerate API keys**” to generate new keys.

<Warning>⚠️ **Security Note**: Never share your secret key. It grants full access to your account via the API.
</Warning>

### Events – Real-Time Collection Tracking

The **Events section** allows you to view all events generated by payments and collects, such as:

  *  Successful payment
