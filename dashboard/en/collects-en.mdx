The **Collects section** allows you to **view, organize, and manage** all your transactions in real time.

### Overview of Collects

Collects are automatically classified into three categories:

    * **All**: all recorded transactions

    * **Successful**: collects completed successfully

    * **Pending**: collects created but not yet paid

### Create a New Collect

To manually record a transaction:

1- Click on "**Add a Collect**."

2- Fill in the required fields:

     * **Client** (select from registered clients)

     * **Amount to collect**

     * **Currency**

     * **Description** (optional)

3- Click "**Add**" to confirm.

Once added, the collect appears with the “**Pending**” status.

You can then **generate a payment link** for this collect and send it to the client: [How to generate a payment link](https://support.fedapay.com/portal/en/kb/articles/comment-g%C3%A9n%C3%A9rer-un-lien-de-paiement)
