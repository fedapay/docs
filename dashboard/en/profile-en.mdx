This section allows you to configure your user account and strengthen access security. It is divided into two main tabs: **Profile** and **Login Activities**.

### Profile – Account Personalization and Security

From your interface, click on your **name or avatar** at the top right of the screen, then select **Settings**. In the **Profile** tab, you can:

   * Edit your **personal information**: first name, last name, display language.

   * Change your **password**.

   * Enable **two-factor authentication (2FA)** to secure your logins.

<Tip>**Security tip**: Enable 2FA to receive a confirmation code by SMS or via an app (such as Google Authenticator).</Tip>

### Login Activities – Account Access Monitoring

The **Login Activities** tab gives you a complete overview of recent login attempts to your account. For each activity, you will see:

   * **Attempt status**: ✅ Success (green) / ⚠️ Failure (yellow)

   * **City / Region / Country**

   * **Date and time**

You can refine your search using the built-in filters:

    * **IP address**

    * **Location** (city, region, country)


<Note>**Good to know**: In case of a suspicious attempt, immediately change your password and activate 2FA if not already enabled.</Note>
