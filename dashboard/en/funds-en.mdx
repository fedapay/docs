This section guides you through the process of withdrawing available funds, currency rules, and managing your payout requests through FedaPay. Here’s how to access your funds and request a payout, step by step.

#### Access Available Funds

Transactions marked as **Transferred** are available in your merchant account balance. Once a transaction is approved, it will take 72 hours to be transferred to your balance.

**Steps to access funds :**

* Add a withdrawal method (bank account, Mobile Money, or bank card) by going to **Business Settings**.

  * **Add a bank account**

  * **Add a Mobile Money number**

  * **Add a bank card**

* Once these details are set up, you can start requesting transfers to your accounts or wallets.

#### Request a Payment

To request a payment, follow these steps:

* Select the relevant balance (based on your preferred currency, for example, Euro or CFA Franc).

* Choose the payment method (Bank Transfer, Mobile Money, etc.).

* Fill out the request form :

  * Enter the amount you want to withdraw.

  * Select the payment method (bank transfer, Mobile Money, bank card).

* Click **Create** to finalize your payment request.

### Additional information on FedaPay withdrawals

Once you have added and verified a **Mobile Money number** or a **bank account** to your FedaPay account, you can initiate withdrawals.

**Security check during the first withdrawal:**  

  * If you initiate a withdrawal **within 10 days following the verification** of your withdrawal method, you will receive a **confirmation email** to validate that the operation was indeed initiated by you.  

  * If the withdrawal is initiated **after 10 days**, you will not receive any additional confirmation email.  

**Conditions for bank transfer withdrawals:**  

  * The withdrawal amount must be **greater than or equal to 53,500 XOF**.  

  * If the amount is below this threshold, **the operation will automatically fail**.  

⚠️ **Best practices:**  

  * Always make sure that your withdrawal information (Mobile Money number or bank account details) is correctly entered and up to date.  

  * Plan your withdrawals taking into account the verification timelines and the limits imposed by banks or Mobile Money operators.  


#### Managing Multi-Currency Balances

FedaPay creates a separate balance for each currency used in your transactions (e.g., one for Euro transactions and another for CFA Franc transactions). This means it’s impossible to merge funds from multiple balances for a single transfer request.

<Note>
  **Important Note**: Although you cannot merge funds from different currencies for a transfer, you can receive all transfers into a single bank account regardless of the currency, and your bank will handle the necessary conversion.
</Note>

#### Tracking Payment Requests

After submitting your payment request, you can track its status in the Payment Requests section of your dashboard. You can filter your requests by :

* Request ID

* Amount

* Status

* Description

* Creation Date

* Approval Date

There’s also an Export to CSV button to download the history of payment requests as a file.
