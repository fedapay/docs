This section explains how to configure and manage users on your FedaPay account. The goal is to assign specific roles and permissions to your collaborators to secure access to your account and protect sensitive data. Here are the steps to add users, assign roles, and manage permissions.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access the Team Section">
    Start by accessing your FedaPay dashboard and going to **Business Settings** > **Team**.

    In this section, you’ll find two tabs: **Users** and **Pending Invitations**.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add a User">
    In the Users tab under the Team section, click Add a User. You can then invite your collaborators to join your FedaPay account.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Role Assignment">
    Each user must have a defined role based on their responsibilities. Here are the three available roles, each with specific levels of access:

    * **Analyst**:  For team members responsible for tracking your business’s financial performance. They can view reports and evaluate transactions.

    * **Developer** : For technical team members, such as programmers, responsible for integrating the FedaPay API or configuring payments on your platform.

    * **Administrator** : Assigned to you as the account owner. The Administrator has full access to manage all aspects of the account.

  <Step title="Track Invitations">
    You can monitor pending invitations in the **Pending Invitations** tab. Once a collaborator accepts your invitation, they will appear in the **Users** tab.
